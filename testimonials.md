> "I heard a presentation of Morgan Lopes today about what it's like to be a junior developer and it got me hooked from the first until the last minute! He only mentioned interesting stuff, never stayed too long at a single topic and he talked overall so passionate about his job that I just enjoyed listening to him. Not only did he inform me about the work of a software engineer, he also took away from me some fears I had of working in the tech industry as a bootcamp graduate." \

> "I thought that Morgan presented a well-intentioned hybrid of guidelines or frameworks and tangible action-pieces in approaching "how to work." I believe this form of communication is best: (i) Here is the the way we think and why we think that way; (ii) Now here are exact actions to be executed in these frameworks."\
