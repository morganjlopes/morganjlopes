# Values & Purpose

> _Pioneer a more beatuiful future for others._

In the summer of 2018, I began feeling an increased tension around decision_-_making. Growing up, we are taught to make decisions while weighing ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. As adults, there is more gray area and less objectivity.

My pursuit of a personal purpose statement was an attempt to highlight what matters most and provide a standard against which to weigh key decisions. More than a job description, it’s a declaration of intent. Based on my unique skills, interests, and passions the purpose statement provides a guiding light.

If we are fortunate, we have the opportunity to choose between multiple great options. Without a clear winner, this can lead to indecision or a lack of directed effort.

#### The Result

_Purpose Statement: Pioneer a more beatuiful future for others._

_Mantra: "Show them \[what's possible]"_

_Guiding Questions:_

* Has it been done before?
* Is it challenging?
* Is there asymmetrical risk-reward?
* Who benefits?
* Who loses?

#### Preferred Context

To maximize my opportunity for impact, there are three main areas where my experience and expertise intersect. While the purpose statement provides direction, the well_-_defined context provides an ‘arena’.

* Business
* Technology
* Social Impact

#### The Personal Purpose Framework

A clearly articulated purpose statement helps make decisions and value accomplishments. After months of personal exploration, I’ve created breadcrumbs for others to follow.

### Personal Values <a href="#1d46" id="1d46"></a>

#### Pursue excellence, not perfection. <a href="#1d46" id="1d46"></a>

Whether in what I do or the way I do it, I care about quality and intentionality. Mistakes happen, but a pursuit of excellence means I learn fast and desire to constantly improve.

#### Create remarkable experiences. <a href="#e04f" id="e04f"></a>

A remarkable experience for my family, my team members, my friends, and my clients is my priority. It comes down to respect and communication.

#### Be effectively human. <a href="#c913" id="c913"></a>

Though playfully put, being ‘effectively human’ captures the tension of programming cold, rigid machines for living, breathing people. Efficiency and productivity are important but they are not the point. I want to engineer solutions that amplify human experiences.

#### Go boldly forward. <a href="#8c02" id="8c02"></a>

Courageous, forward movement is key to innovating and doing work that matters. I love to collaborate, pushing myself and others to improve. Wherever possible, I bring others with me.
